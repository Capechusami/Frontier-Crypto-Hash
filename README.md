# 🔐 Cybersecurity SHA-256 Hashing Implementation

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers a **clean, practical, and educational** Python implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing algorithm. It was developed as part of a **Cybersecurity Practical Application assignment (Question 2 – Hashing, 8 Marks)** and is designed to clearly demonstrate real-world hashing concepts such as **data integrity, security, and the avalanche effect**.

Whether you're a student, beginner, or cybersecurity enthusiast, this project provides a hands-on way to understand how modern cryptographic hash functions work under the hood.
